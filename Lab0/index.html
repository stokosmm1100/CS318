        <h2>Graphic Communications</h2>
      <p>My dream job is to be an art director.</p>
        <h3>Junior</h3>
     <p>In this class I would like to learn Html/Css and pass with a good enough grade for the credit.</p>
        <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>My favorite things are drifting, and video games. Ever since I could play with hotwheels I've liked cars, and sine 2016/17 I've been obsessed with drifting specifically.<br>To me it's because its more about style and not speed/competition. I've also been playing videogames for as long as I can remember and its the easiest way for me to decompress.</p>
