<li>6 tbsp soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tbsp black vinegar</li>
<li>6 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
<li>thumb-sice piece of ginger, finely sliced</li>
<li>2 tbsp cumin fresh ground</li>
<li>2 tbsp chili powder</li>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>For the dough, mix together the flour with 200ml of the water and mix with your hand until it has come together. Add the rest of the water if needed.</li>
    <li>Turn out onto a floured bench and knead for 5 minutes or until smooth.</li>
    <li>Place into a bowl and cover with a damp paper towel, rest for 20 minutes.</li> 
    <li>After 20 minutes, turn out back onto the bench and knead it again until itâ€™s nice and smooth before forming it into a log shape.</li>
    <li>Keeping a nice neat shape, roll until you have a 30cm x 20cm rectangle.</li>
    <li>>Cut the rectangle into 6 even pieces and brush both sides with oil.</li>
    <li>Place into an airtight container and in the fridge to rest for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>>When ready to serve, have a large pot of water on to boil and make sure you have all the garnishes ready.</li>
    <li>Take the noodles from the fridge. Grab one piece and place a chopstick on the centre and press to make a line down the middle.</li>
    <li>Holding each end of the dough evenly with your thumb, start to stretch with even tension.</li>
    <li>>When your arms get roughly 60cm apart, you can start to slap the noodles on the bench.</li>
    <li>When the noodle is about 100cm long, you can split the noodle on the seam to make 2 noodles.</li>
    <li>Immediately place the noodles into the boiling water and cook for 1 minute before you add the bok choy.</li>
    <li>After 2 more minutes, remove from the water and place into a separate bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the topping into the centre (spring onions, garlic, ginger, chilli and cumin) and pour 1 tbsp of the soy vinegar sauce around the outside.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a small pot over a med heat until it just starts to smoke.</li>
    <li>Pour the hot oil over the centre of the spices and aromatics.</li>
    <li>Mix the noodles well and serve!</li>
</ol>
