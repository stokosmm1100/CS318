<h2>Inside Outfit</h2>
            <p>In Eau Claire there is a drift team that partakes in events at USAIR named Inside Outfit. Funny story, I am from Madison and have loved drifting since I was in middle school. I moved to Eau Claire for school and little did I know I would eventually meet a couple of my idols. All because of a sticker on my water bottle. I have been doing simple graphic design work for them for stickers and recently a hoodie design that should be a physical product by the end of the week. Here are the members of the team and what they drive.</p>
